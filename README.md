# What is this app?

This is a complete app where you can visualize a table, and you can add, delete or modify information of that table. That table was made with SQLLite and was imported to the project.
All this stuff is imeplementated through a user-friendly GUI straightforward an intuitive to use. 

I upload the main script (huge) with detailed explainations in each line of the code to can follow step by step what is doing each line, method, class... everything. 

Of course, the main script is formatted with BLACK.
